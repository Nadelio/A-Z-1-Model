#### Lore:
> Orion Initiative is a group formed to help combat the Kaiju threat. They develop military robots that have the ability to adapt to combat situations and evolve their form to fit new situations.
> A-Z-1 is the 26th iteration of these robots, it has an abnormality that allows it to control other robots and act on its own will. It went rogue in 2220 and was taken captive in 2221. It now stays imprisoned in an Orion facility.

> Location: ``Unknown``

> Damage: ``Sustained major damage to lower torso : Left hand destroyed : Right hand destroyed : Legs destroyed : Neural pathway abnormality detected : Evolutionary Complex anomaly detected : END REPORT``

> Names follow this pattern:
> The first letter is inital iteration, second letter is the sub-iteration, the number is the robot count for the iteration-subiteration, so A-Z-1 is the: ``1st iteration - 26th subiteration - 1st robot made of these iterations``
